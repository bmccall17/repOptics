**The WIDGET Framework**

*A Product Development Framework Based on*

*Patrick Lencioni's 6 Types of Working Genius*

A Lesson Framework for Product Builders

# **Introduction: Why WIDGET?**

Every product, every project, every initiative follows the same fundamental journey from spark to completion. Patrick Lencioni's 6 Types of Working Genius provides a powerful lens for understanding this journey—not just as a sequence of activities, but as a progression through different types of cognitive and emotional work that require different gifts.

The WIDGET acronym (**W**onder, **I**nvention, **D**iscernment, **G**alvanizing, **E**nablement, **T**enacity) represents the natural sequence of work. Understanding this flow helps us:

* Identify where we are in the product lifecycle  
* Understand what type of work (and people) each phase requires  
* Avoid skipping critical phases that lead to failure  
* Match talent to the work that energizes them

# **The Three Phases of Work**

Lencioni groups the six geniuses into three natural phases. Each phase is essential—skipping any phase (especially Activation) leads to common organizational dysfunctions.

| IDEATION Wonder \+ Invention *"What could be?"* | ACTIVATION Discernment \+ Galvanizing *"Should we & who's in?"* | IMPLEMENTATION Enablement \+ Tenacity *"Let's get it done."* |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

**The Critical Insight:** Most teams skip the Activation phase, jumping directly from "great idea" to "let's build it." This leads to building the wrong things, misallocated resources, and blame when projects fail. The Activation phase—evaluating ideas (Discernment) and rallying commitment (Galvanizing)—is the bridge that ensures only worthy ideas get built with the right support.

# **How F.L.O.W. Maps to WIDGET**

The F.L.O.W. framework (Foundation, Launch, Operate, Win) popularized for AI-assisted development maps naturally to WIDGET—but notably omits some critical phases. Here's how they align:

| WIDGET | F.L.O.W. | Analysis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Wonder** | *(Implicit)* | F.L.O.W. assumes you already know what to build. Wonder is the crucial "why" that precedes "what." |
| **Invention** | **Foundation** | Foundation's "challenge thinking, create SOP" maps to ideation. This is where AI prompting and vision creation happen. |
| **Discernment** | *(Partial)* | F.L.O.W.'s artifact review provides some discernment, but lacks formal evaluation gates. |
| **Galvanizing** | **Launch** | Launch is the "go" signal—starting the build, spinning up agents, getting resources mobilized. |
| **Enablement** | **Operate** | Operate covers the ongoing work—parallel agents, inbox management, iterative development. |
| **Tenacity** | **Win** | Win focuses on deployment and sharing. Tenacity adds the crucial quality standards and completion drive. |

**Key Insight:** F.L.O.W. is optimized for solo builders with AI assistance who already have validated ideas. WIDGET is the complete framework that includes the pre-work (Wonder) and quality assurance (Tenacity standards) that F.L.O.W. assumes or underweights.

# **Phase 1: IDEATION**

*Identifying needs and proposing solutions*

| W — WONDER | I — INVENTION |
| ----- | ----- |
| *The ability to ponder, speculate, and question the state of things—asking questions that provoke answers and action.* | *Coming up with new ideas and solutions—origination, creativity, and ingenuity, even with little direction and context.* |
| **Core Question:** Is there a better way? What's missing? Should we be doing this differently? | **Core Question:** What if we tried this? How might we solve this? |
| **Inputs:** • Market signals and anomalies • User feedback and complaints • Competitive landscape observations • Internal friction points • Emerging technology trends • Stakeholder conversations | **Inputs:** • Problem hypotheses from Wonder • Research findings and insights • Analogous solutions from other domains • Technical possibility space • Resource constraints (known) • User needs and jobs-to-be-done |
| **Key Activities:** • Environmental scanning • Empathy research (user interviews, shadowing) • Assumption challenging sessions • "Five Whys" root cause exploration • Horizon scanning for disruption • Reflection and contemplation time | **Key Activities:** • Ideation workshops and brainstorming • Rapid prototyping and sketching • Solution design sprints • "How Might We" exercises • Cross-functional jam sessions • Concept development and iteration |
| **Key Decisions:** • Is this worth exploring further? • Who else should we talk to? • What questions remain unanswered? • Is our current state acceptable? | **Key Decisions:** • Which ideas have the most promise? • What's technically feasible? • Which solutions are worth developing further? • What's our initial hypothesis? |
| **Outputs:** • Problem hypothesis statements • Opportunity areas identified • Research questions to pursue • Initial problem framing documents | **Outputs:** • Solution concepts and proposals • Low-fidelity prototypes • Feature hypotheses • Initial product vision • Rough technical approach |

**Teaching Point:** Wonder often feels "unproductive" to action-oriented teams. It's the contemplative work of asking "should we?" before "how do we?" Many failed products stem from skipping Wonder—building solutions to problems no one has. Invention without Wonder is just random creativity.

**Transition Trigger:** Move to Activation when you have: (1) clearly articulated problem hypotheses, (2) potential solutions that address real user needs, and (3) enough concept clarity to evaluate and prioritize.

# **Phase 2: ACTIVATION**

*Evaluating merit and rallying commitment*

| D — DISCERNMENT | G — GALVANIZING |
| ----- | ----- |
| *Instinct, intuition, and uncanny judgment—the ability to assess ideas using pattern recognition and gut feel.* | *Rallying, motivating, and provoking people to take action around an idea or initiative—inspiring and enlisting others.* |
| **Core Question:** Is this idea actually good? What's missing? Does this feel right? | **Core Question:** Who do we need? How do we get them excited? What's the rallying cry? |
| **Inputs:** • Solution concepts from Invention • Market data and validation signals • Technical feasibility assessments • Strategic alignment criteria • Risk indicators • Stakeholder feedback | **Inputs:** • Prioritized solutions from Discernment • Stakeholder map • Resource availability • Team capacity and skills • Budget and timeline constraints • Communication channels |
| **Key Activities:** • Concept evaluation and scoring • Assumption testing and validation • Expert review sessions • Risk assessment workshops • User testing and feedback synthesis • Business case refinement | **Key Activities:** • Building the coalition of support • Creating compelling vision narratives • Stakeholder alignment meetings • Resource negotiation and allocation • Kickoff planning and communication • Team formation and role clarity |
| **Key Decisions:** • Go/No-Go on concepts • Priority ranking of solutions • Which assumptions need validation? • What risks are acceptable? • Is this aligned with strategy? | **Key Decisions:** • Who needs to be involved? • What's the timeline and milestones? • How do we communicate the vision? • What resources do we need? • Who owns what? |
| **Outputs:** • Prioritized solution backlog • Refined product requirements • Risk mitigation plans • Go/No-Go recommendations • Investment case documentation | **Outputs:** • Committed team and resources • Project charter / brief • Communication plan • Milestone roadmap • RACI or ownership matrix |

**Teaching Point:** This is the most commonly skipped phase. Teams jump from "great idea\!" directly to building. Without Discernment, you build things that shouldn't be built. Without Galvanizing, you lack the commitment and resources to see it through. The Activation phase is where good judgment and organizational will combine.

**Transition Trigger:** Move to Implementation when you have: (1) validated concepts with clear priority, (2) committed resources and team, (3) clear success criteria and timeline, and (4) stakeholder alignment and support.

# **Phase 3: IMPLEMENTATION**

*Getting things done and across the finish line*

| E — ENABLEMENT | T — TENACITY |
| ----- | ----- |
| *Providing support and assistance in the way it's needed—responding to needs without conditions and anticipating what's required.* | *The satisfaction of pushing things across the finish line—not only capable of, but naturally inclined to finish projects to specification.* |
| **Core Question:** What do you need from me? How can I help remove blockers? | **Core Question:** Is it done? Does it meet the standard? What's left to complete? |
| **Inputs:** • Project charter from Galvanizing • Team needs and requests • Sprint backlogs and tasks • Blocker reports • Resource requests • Cross-functional dependencies | **Inputs:** • Working product from Enablement • Quality standards and acceptance criteria • Definition of Done • Launch checklist • Performance benchmarks • Stakeholder expectations |
| **Key Activities:** • Active development and execution • Cross-functional coordination • Blocker removal and escalation • Process facilitation • Quality assurance and testing • Stakeholder updates and demos | **Key Activities:** • Final QA and polish • Documentation completion • Launch preparation and execution • Deployment and release management • Post-launch monitoring • Retrospective and lessons learned |
| **Key Decisions:** • What's the priority order? • How do we resolve blockers? • Where do we need help? • What trade-offs do we accept? • When do we escalate? | **Key Decisions:** • Is this ready to ship? • What's blocking completion? • Do we accept this quality level? • When do we call it done? • What needs follow-up? |
| **Outputs:** • Working product increments • Sprint deliverables • Updated documentation • Test results and feedback • Progress reports | **Outputs:** • Shipped product / feature • Launch communications • User documentation • Success metrics baseline • Retrospective insights • Maintenance handoff |

**Teaching Point:** Enablement and Tenacity are different gifts. Enablers love responding to needs and making work possible—but may lose energy in the final 10%. Tenacious people get energy from completion and standards—but may not respond fluidly to emerging needs. Great teams need both.

**Completion Trigger:** The cycle is complete when: (1) the product/feature is shipped, (2) quality standards are met, (3) documentation is complete, (4) handoff or maintenance plan exists, and (5) retrospective insights captured for the next cycle.

# **Common Framework Failures**

Understanding what goes wrong helps diagnose team dysfunctions:

| Failure Pattern | Root Cause | WIDGET Diagnosis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Building products nobody wants | Skipped Wonder | Need more contemplation and user research before inventing |
| Endless brainstorming, no action | Stuck in Invention | Need Discernment to evaluate and select; need Galvanizing to commit |
| Analysis paralysis | Stuck in Discernment | Need Galvanizing to force decisions and rally action |
| Projects start strong, fizzle out | Weak Tenacity | Need someone who gets energy from completion and standards |
| Team burnout, everything is urgent | Weak Enablement | Need people who anticipate needs and remove blockers |
| Finger-pointing when projects fail | Skipped Activation | Ideators blame implementers; implementers blame ideators. The bridge was missing. |

# **Practical Application: Using WIDGET**

## **1\. Diagnose Your Team Composition**

Map your team's geniuses. Look for gaps and clusters. A team heavy on Wonder/Invention but light on Tenacity will generate ideas but struggle to ship.

## **2\. Match People to Phases**

Let people lead during phases that match their genius. The Wonderer should drive discovery. The Galvanizer should run the kickoff. The Tenacious should own the launch checklist.

## **3\. Make Transitions Explicit**

Name the phase you're in. "We're still in Ideation" sets different expectations than "We're in Implementation." Unclear transitions cause conflict when people apply the wrong type of work.

## **4\. Protect Against Skip Patterns**

Build in checkpoints. Before Implementation, ask: "Have we properly evaluated these ideas?" (Discernment) and "Do we have real commitment and resources?" (Galvanizing). Gate reviews prevent expensive failures.

# **Conclusion: The Full Cycle**

Every successful product follows WIDGET, whether the team knows it or not. The teams that excel are the ones who:

1. **Honor Wonder**—take time to ask "should we?" before "how?"   
2. **Unleash Invention**—create space for genuine creativity  
3. **Apply Discernment**—rigorously evaluate before committing  
4. **Galvanize Commitment**—rally people and resources with clarity  
5. **Enable Progress**—remove blockers and respond to needs  
6. **Maintain Tenacity**—push through obstacles to quality completion

When everyone on the team understands WIDGET, conflict transforms into collaboration. The Wonderer isn't "slow"—they're doing essential contemplative work. The Tenacious person isn't "picky"—they're ensuring quality. Each genius has its place in the cycle.

The framework reveals that product development isn't just a process—it's a human endeavor requiring diverse gifts, working in sequence, toward a shared goal.
