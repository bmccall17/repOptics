# Friction Log Template

> **Purpose**: Document the friction points and decision-making process during a project build. After completing 3 projects using this template, extract patterns to evolve the repOptics Question Bank.

## Project Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Project Name | |
| Start Date | |
| End Date | |
| Project Type | prototype / internal tool / client demo / production |
| Solo or Team | |

## Decisions Made Upfront

What did you decide before writing any code?

| Decision | Options Considered | Choice Made | Confidence (1-5) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Example: Framework | Next.js, Remix, Astro | Next.js | 5 |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

---

## Decisions Deferred

What did you explicitly choose NOT to decide upfront?

| Decision | Why Deferred | When Will You Decide? |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Example: Database | Don't know data needs yet | After building MVP features |
| | | |
| | | |

## Friction Points

Log each time you got stuck, confused, or had to backtrack.

### Friction #1

**Date**:
**What happened**:

**How long were you stuck**:

**What would have prevented this**:
- [ ] A question during project setup
- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] A different tool choice
- [ ] Nothing - this was necessary exploration

**Question that would have helped**:
> (Write the exact question that, if answered upfront, would have prevented this friction)

### Friction #2

**Date**:
**What happened**:

**How long were you stuck**:

**What would have prevented this**:
- [ ] A question during project setup
- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] A different tool choice
- [ ] Nothing - this was necessary exploration

**Question that would have helped**:

### Friction #3

**Date**:
**What happened**:

**How long were you stuck**:

**What would have prevented this**:
- [ ] A question during project setup
- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] A different tool choice
- [ ] Nothing - this was necessary exploration

**Question that would have helped**:

## Questions to Add to Question Bank

Based on this project, what questions should repOptics ask users?

| Question | Category | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| | intent / runtime / data / deploy / cost / guardrails | |
| | | |
| | | |

## Consequences Discovered

What consequences of your decisions did you discover during the build?

| Decision | Expected Consequence | Actual Consequence |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|

*After completing 3 projects with friction logs, review all logs together to identify patterns and evolve the Question Bank in `/lib/questions.ts`.*
